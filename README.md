If you wish to set up your own, read [here](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/) and [here](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/blob/master/README.md).
You may also find it helpful to explore online for other dotfile repos based on Dotbot.

**Note**: I created this repo back when I was confined to working with Vim 7.3, which did not support native plugin management or newer plugins for snippet management (e.g. [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips)), and haven't been bothered to update yet.
